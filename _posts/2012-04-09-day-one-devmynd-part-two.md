## After Hours

I trooped downtown to meet up with [Arvin Dang](http://twitter.com/arvindang) and help him build a Jobs Board for [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.org). We scaffolded the piss out of it, and sat down and figured out how to integrate Redcarpet into Rails. It wasn't hard per se, but the documentation for it is spotty (open source contribution opportunity, anyone?), and Arvin isn't exactly the super-patient let's-read-the-documentation-and-figure-it-out type, so I ended up looking through the [tests on github](https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet/blob/master/test/redcarpet_test.rb#L57) to see how to use it, which really just reinforced my belief that good tests can serve as documentation (not ideal, but it works).

I did a few more [Rubeque](http://rubeque.com/) problems. Nearly done with the 'Elementary' level problems.

Brad (my new boss!) came over to Code Academy after calling it a day at *The Client* and hung out (hanged out?), then gave me a lift in Soupcan, his sweet ride. We picked up some supplies for the new office at <strike>Home Depot</strike> Lowes, then called it a night.
