## TLDR: Rubeque.com rocks. Go check it out.

If you haven't explored it out yet, [Rubeque](http://rubeque.com) is great! It is basically [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/) for Ruby (guess 4Ruby just didn't have the same ring to it, or was just too easy to say).

Rubeque gives you a list of problems to solve. Each problem has some test:unit assertions that you need to get to pass. Sometimes that means completing the test, sometimes it means writing the code that gets the complete tests to pass. Either way, after solving the problem, you can see everyone else's solutions, which is where a lot of my learning has been happening.

## Things I don't like
+ Impossible-to-pronounce name.
+ The quality of the exercises varies wildly.
+ The clarity of what the user is expected to do on each exercise varies wildly.

## Things I do like
+ It's Ruby.
+ It's [open source](https://github.com/daviddavis/rubeque).
+ It's test-driven development
+ It's helping me learn Ruby, and shows alternate solutions after I solve each problem.

If I were a teacher, and decided I liked handing out arbitrary grades, I'd give Rubeque a B-.
