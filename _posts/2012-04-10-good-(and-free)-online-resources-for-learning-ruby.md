## The List

This list is presented in the order I think a complete newbie should
approach them. It includes only resources that cost zero monies.

+ [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/) is a basic introduction to Ruby based
  on the [classic](http://www.rubyinside.com/media/poignant-guide.pdf) by why. It shouldn't take more than an afternoon to work through, if that.
+ [Learn to Program by Chris Pine](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) This
  is the best introduction to Ruby and programming I have encountered.
Make sure to actually do the exercises at the end of each chapter.
+ [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/). I don't know how it ends yet, but I like the beginning.
+ [Hackety Hack](http://hackety.com/) was recommended to me by Corey
Haines. A+.
+ [Ruby Monk](http://rubymonk.com/). I'll let the website tell you what
  it is. It's at the bottomish of the list because I haven't yet done it
myself.
+ [Ruby mailing list](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/mailing-lists/). Go sign yourself up for this so you can ask smart and helpful people questions when you get stuck.
+ [Rubeque](http://rubeque.com/) is a collection of problems to solve
  with Ruby. It also serves as an introduction to how tests work.
+ [Ruby Kickstart](http://ruby-kickstart.com/) is good for when you get
  sick of reading tutorials. It's seven videos aimed at getting you up
to speed with Ruby. Good luck!
+ [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) is a collection of tests that you
  have to get to pass. It helps the learner understand how Ruby does
things.
+ [Ruby docs](http://www.ruby-doc.org/) will become your friend once you
  learn how to parse it, which takes time.
