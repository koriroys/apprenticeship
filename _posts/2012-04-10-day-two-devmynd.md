## Round Two, Fight!

Day two started at 7am at code and coffee. Brad was already there when I
arrived, and bought me coffee. I checked in with a few regulars, and
introduced myself to a few new faces (new to me anyways). Brad and I
figured out what I should do for the day. He said one of the reasons he
decided to go with me is because "you don't completely suck at writing"
(his words not mine). So it was decided I should set up a blog and push
out some content, and make a list of good [free online resources for
learning Ruby](http://koriroys.com/apprenticeship/learning/2012/04/10/good-%28and-free%29-online-resources-for-learning-ruby). 

So the blog was created, a few posts were drafted up, and so more
Rubeque problems were polished off. I paired with Bryon in the morning
and learned how to write rake tasks.
[Furnishlyst](http://furnishlyst.com) is blowing up!

Corey Haines bent my arm a little about [code retreat floyd](http://coderetreatfloyd2012.eventbrite.com/), and seeing
the guest list, well, I had little choice but to sign up. Not sure how
I'm getting there yet, but we'll figure that out.

In other news, I will be mentoring not one, but two [Code
Academy](http://codeacademy.org) students. One, [Justin Tallant](http://justintallant.com/), lives upstairs, so that should be pretty simple to set up sessions. The other, [Chris Liang](http://twitter.com/chriscliang), I know nothing about yet, but [Vince](http://twitter.com/vcabansag) says he's cool, so I'm excited to meet him Thursday at the mentor/student meetup.
